# Omni-Present BackEnd Task

> Dated : 4th Of August, 2021.

## Overview

We need to build a backend Rest API Endpoint that takes in some list of information and returns updated list with some additional information.

## Given

- We're given a list of employees.

## Goals

- Implement a Rest API Endpoint that takes in the list of employee and returns the same list with some additional data attached to each employee.
- Fetch relevant country specific information to each employee and append that information to each employee.

## External Links

> To fetch details for a country, use the following API - [Rest countries ](https://restcountries.eu/)

## Assumptions

- Assuming, for that each employee we need to attach additional information based on its country. The Employee list would have a number of employees and a single employee record must contain some attributes i.e. name, phone number, address, country etc.
- In all of those country is a must attribute because that is what the additional details would be fetched upon.
